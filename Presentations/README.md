- This are all the presentation for the project
- there are 2 presentations
1. Mid semester Presentation
2. End semester Presentation

# Introduction
- Issue of detecting and tracking objects and entities when they are occluded by substances such as Clouds, Fog, Rain, and Walls.

- Objects that are partially or completely obscured by other objects or the environment lead to errors in object detection and tracking, which can impact the overall performance of the system.

- The goal of this project is to develop a robust object detection and tracking system using DEEPSORT which aims to achieve high accuracy and robustness in tracking multiple objects in challenging scenarios and enable a wider range of application.
